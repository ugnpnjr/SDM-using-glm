# R script and data to run SDM using generalised linear model

This tutorial uses the glm() function to run the species distribution model.
This model is useful if you have data collected for one-time only OR you do not have temporal replicates. This is the trend with most large-scale studies under logistical and financial constraints.
I have not uploaded raw raster files because they are heavy (>400MB). Please contact ugyenpenjor.bt@gmail.com to request a copy of the data. I do not provide GPS coordinates of the species because the study species is globally endangered (dhole *Cuon alpinus*). However, this model can be run even without coordinates. 
Additional codes to check for spatial autocorrelation (plots included) and correction for autocorrelation are also included.
