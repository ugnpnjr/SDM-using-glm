# R script and data to run SDM using generalised linear model

This tutorial uses glm() function to run species distribution model.
This model is useful if you have data gathered for one-time only and you do not have temporal replicates. This is the trend with most large-scale studies under logistical and financial constraints.
I have not uploaded raw raster files because the raster files to produce species distribution map are heavy (>400MB). Please contact ugyenpenjor.bt@gmail.com to request a copy of the data. I do not provide GPS coordinates of the species because the study species is a globally endangered species (dhole *Cuon alpinus*). 
However, this model can be run even witout species coordinates. 
Additional codes to add arrow and scale on the map can be requested from the author.
Additional codes to check for spatial autocorrelation (plots included) and correction for autocorrelation are also included.
