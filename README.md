# SDM-using-glm

This tutorial uses glm() function to run species distribution model.
This model is useful if you have data gathered for one-time only and you do not have temporal replicates. This is the trend with most large-scale studies under logistical and financial constraints.
I have not uploaded data because the raster files to produce species distribution map are heavy (>400MB). Please contact ugyenpenjor.bt@gmail.com to request a copy of the data. I do not provide species GPS locations because the study species is a globally endangered species. 
However, this model can be run even witout species coordinates. 
Additional codes to add arrow and scale can be requested from the author.
